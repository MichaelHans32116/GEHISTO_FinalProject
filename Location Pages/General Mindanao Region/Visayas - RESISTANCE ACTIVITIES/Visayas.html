            During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, the Visayas region was a stronghold of Filipino resistance, marked by organized guerrilla warfare and civilian support networks. Local guerrilla units, such as those led by Colonel Macario Peralta in Panay and Colonel Salvador Abcede in Negros, played crucial roles in disrupting Japanese operations. These groups conducted sabotage missions, ambushes, and intelligence gathering, often aided by local communities who provided food, shelter, and information.

            In Leyte and Samar, guerrilla forces coordinated closely with Allied forces, especially during the lead-up to the Leyte Gulf landings in 1944. Despite limited resources, the resistance maintained communication lines through makeshift radio systems and courier networks, contributing significantly to weakening Japanese control and preparing the region for liberation.
