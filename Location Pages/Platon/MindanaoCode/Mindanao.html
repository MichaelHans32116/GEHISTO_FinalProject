    <h2>Guerrilla Activity</h2>
    <p>
      During World War II, the Mindanao region in the Philippines became a significant battleground against the Japanese occupation. After the fall of Corregidor and other key defenses in 1942, many Filipino soldiers and American military personnel who had escaped Japanese capture formed guerrilla groups to continue the fight. One of the most notable resistance efforts was led by Colonel Wendell Fertig in Northern Mindanao.<br>

    </p>

      His guerrilla force carried out sabotage missions, gathered intelligence, and launched attacks on Japanese forces in preparation for the American invasion of Mindanao in 1945. Fertig's efforts were crucial in disrupting Japanese operations and aiding in the eventual liberation of Mindanao by Allied forces.
