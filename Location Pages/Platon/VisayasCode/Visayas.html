    <h2>Resistance Activity</h2>
    <p>
      During World War II, the Visayas region was a key area of resistance against Japanese occupation.
      Many locals, including farmers and former soldiers, formed guerrilla units to fight back.
      One major group was <button class="black-army"> <a href="/Location Pages/Platon/VisayasCode/Blackarmy.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: white;">THE BLACK ARMY</a></button>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>These guerrilla groups played a crucial role in weakening Japanese control, gathering vital intelligence,
      and preparing for the eventual return of General Douglas MacArthur and the Allied forces. The resistance
      in the Visayas was not only a fight for independence but also a fight for survival and freedom for the
      Filipino people.
