            <img src="/Location Pages/bataan/images/bataan-invasion.jpg" alt="Japanese invasion of the Philippines">
            <p>The Japanese attack on the Philippines began on December 8, 1941, just hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor due to the time zone difference. Japanese forces launched air raids targeting Clark Air Base, Iba Air Base, and Manila, crippling American air defenses. By December 10, 1941, Japanese forces began their land invasion with initial landings in Aparri, Vigan, and Legazpi.</p>
            <p>The most significant invasion occurred at Lingayen Gulf on December 22, 1941, where General Douglas MacArthur ordered retreat to Bataan to reorganize. Around 43,000 Japanese soldiers made up the primary invasion force, which overran American and Filipino forces when they arrived in the Lingayen Gulf. A secondary invasion took place on December 24, 1941, in Lamon Bay, south of Manila, trapping U.S. and Filipino forces between two advancing Japanese forces.</p>

            <p>By the end of December, Manila was declared an open city to prevent destruction but the Japanese still occupied it on January 2, 1942. As Japanese forces advanced, General MacArthur ordered a strategic withdrawal to Bataan following a prewar defense plan called War Plan Orange. The plan was to hold out until reinforcements arrived but the rapid advance of the Japanese prevented this strategy from succeeding.</p>

            <p>Officially starting on January 7, 1942, the Battle of Bataan lasted from January to April 1942. Under the leadership of Generals Edward King and Jonathan Wainwright, the 80,000 American and Filipino forces established a defensive line across the peninsula. At first, General Masaharu Homma's Japanese forces suffered from surprisingly strong opposition, illness, and a lack of supplies.</p>
            <p>With Japanese forces cutting off supply lines and the loss of U.S. naval and aviation help, the defenders faced malnutrition, fatigue, and illness. In order to survive, soldiers turned to consuming roots, carabaos, and even monkeys. The defenders were overrun by further Japanese troops, including tanks and artillery, that arrived in early April 1942.</p>
            <p>The final offensive began on April 3, 1942, breaking through the defensive lines, and Mount Samat, one of the last strongholds, fell on April 8. On April 9, 1942, General Edward King unconditionally surrendered, realizing that further resistance would only result in mass slaughter. This marked the start of Japanese military rule.</p>

                <p>"The fall of Bataan was a significant blow to the Allied forces in terms of morale and resources. It also underscored the difficulties of defending the Philippines with limited supplies and personnel, and it signaled the intensity and ruthlessness of the war in the Pacific."</p>

            <p>Following the surrender on April 9, 1942, approximately 75,000 Filipino and American prisoners of war were subjected to the infamous Bataan Death March - a 65-mile (105 km) forced march from Mariveles, Bataan to San Fernando, Pampanga.</p>
            <p>The prisoners were marched in intense heat with little food or water. Those who fell behind or showed any sign of weakness were beaten, bayoneted, or shot. Estimates of deaths during the march range from 5,000 to 18,000 Filipinos and 500 to 650 Americans.</p>
            <p>After reaching San Fernando, survivors were packed into boxcars and transported by rail to Camp O'Donnell, where thousands more would die from disease, malnutrition, and mistreatment in the following weeks.</p>

            <p>The defense of Bataan and the subsequent Death March remain powerful symbols of courage and sacrifice in both American and Filipino history. The Bataan Death March was later judged by an Allied military commission to be a Japanese war crime.</p>
            <p>Today, memorials stand in both the Philippines and the United States, including the Bataan Death March Memorial in New Mexico where an annual commemorative march is held. April 9 is observed as "Araw ng Kagitingan" (Day of Valor) in the Philippines, a national holiday honoring the heroes of Bataan.</p>
            <p>The shared suffering of Filipino and American soldiers during this period forged a strong bond between the two nations that continues to be remembered today. Despite the defeat, the U.S. and Filipino forces remained determined to eventually liberate the Philippines, which was achieved in 1944 with the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the eventual recapture of Manila.</p>
