That day, 150-200 Japanese planes (mostly bombers) struck Leyte. U.S. forces shot down 66 (18 probable) using 50 planes, losing 3.

This closes a campaign that has had few counterparts in the utter destruction of the enemy's forces with a maximum conservation of our own. It has been a magnificent performance on the part of all concerned.'</div>
