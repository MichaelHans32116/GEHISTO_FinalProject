            <p>Following the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 8, 1941, Japanese forces quickly advanced on Manila. By December 26, 1941, Manila was declared an open city by General Douglas MacArthur to prevent its destruction, but the Japanese still occupied it on January 2, 1942.</p>
            <p>Under Japanese rule, Manila suffered severe economic hardship. The Japanese took control of all banks and the money supply, resulting in hyperinflation. The sugar industry was completely shut down, and lack of fuel, poor transportation, and ineffective policies led to food shortages. By 1945, the GDP had shrunk by 70%, and the price of rice skyrocketed from ₱6 to ₱60 per kilo.</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">

            <p>Filipinos were forced to work under miserable conditions with insufficient food and healthcare. The standard of living deteriorated rapidly due to rationing and failing industries. The occupation resulted in severe economic suffering through inflation, food shortages, forced labor, and rationing.</p>

            <img src="/Location Pages/manila/images/manila-battle.jpg" alt="Battle of Manila">
            <p>The 29-day battle to retake Manila in February 1945 proved a fight unlike any other in the Pacific War - a bloody urban brawl that forced American soldiers to battle block by block, house by house, and even room by room. The end result was the catastrophic destruction of the city and a rampage by Japanese troops that terrorized the civilian population.</p>
            <p>Landmarks were demolished, houses torched, countless women raped, and their husbands and children murdered. An estimated 100,000 civilians were slain in a massacre as heinous as the Rape of Nanking. The battle left Manila in ruins, with its water, electricity, and transportation systems destroyed.</p>

            <p>The 37th Infantry Division worked to restore water, electricity, and security, managing looting and clearing mines. By March 29, the division left for its next campaign.
