    <h1 class="title">COMFORT WOMEN - 1932</h1>
    <p>
        It’s been nearly a century since the first women were forced into sexual slavery for Imperial Japan, but the details of their servitude remain painful and politically divisive in Japan and the countries it once occupied. 
        Records of the women’s subjugation is scant; there are very few survivors and an estimated 90 percent of “comfort women” did not survive the war. 
        Though military brothels existed in the Japanese military since 1932, they expanded widely after one of the most infamous incidents in imperial Japan’s attempt to take over the Republic of China and a broad swath of Asia: the Rape of Nanking. On December 13, 1937, Japanese troops began a six-week-long massacre that essentially destroyed the Chinese city of Nanking. 
        Along the way, Japanese troops raped between 20,000 and 80,000 Chinese women. The mass rapes horrified the world, and Emperor Hirohito was concerned with its impact on Japan’s image. As legal historian Carmen M. Agibay notes, he ordered the military to expand its so-called “comfort stations,” or military brothels, in an effort to prevent further atrocities, reduce sexually transmitted diseases and ensure a steady and isolated group of prostitutes to satisfy Japanese soldiers’ sexual appetites. 
        Kempeitai, also known as “Kenpeitai,” was the infamous Japanese military police from 1881 to 1945. In Japanese-occupied territories, this police force was in charge of arresting and executing those who were suspected of being anti-Japanese. They were notorious for their brutal treatment of prisoners during World War II (WWII). Many historians refer to them as Japan’s version of the Gestapo, the official secret police of Nazi Germany. 
        They were trained under Japan’s War Ministry and even had an interrogation manual provided by their government. 
        One of the cautions stated in the manual, “Care must be exercised when making use of rebukes, invective or torture as it will result in his telling falsehoods and making a fool of you.” 
        Mark Felton, in his book <em>Japan’s Gestapo: Murder, Mayhem and Torture in Wartime Asia</em>, noted that the uniformity in methods of torture practiced by the Kempeitai throughout the Japanese occupation zone suggested a definite policy adopted by the armed forces at the direct instigation of the government in Tokyo. 
        “Often, Kempeitai investigators cared little whether confessions were made voluntarily or made under duress so torture served a useful and normally quick role in confirming Kempeitai suspicions. Essentially, if you were arrested by the Kempeitai your fate was usually already sealed.”
