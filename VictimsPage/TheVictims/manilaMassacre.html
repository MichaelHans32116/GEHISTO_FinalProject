        <!-- Full content -->
        The Battle of Manila in 1945 was one of the most destructive and tragic conflicts in World War II, as U.S. forces fought to liberate the Philippine capital from entrenched Japanese military units. 
            Beginning on February 3, 1945, the battle involved intense urban warfare, with American troops engaged in brutal house-to-house combat to retake the city. The Japanese forces, realizing they could not hold the city indefinitely, dug in and fortified key areas, including the historic Intramuros district. 
            This led to heavy casualties on both sides, but the human cost was particularly high for civilians. The battle is remembered not only for its military significance but for the horrendous toll it took on Manilaâ€™s civilian population. Between 100,000 and 200,000 people, mostly Filipino civilians, were killed during the battle, many of them victims of Japanese war crimes. 
            Mass executions, rape, and other brutal tactics were used by the Japanese forces as they attempted to resist the American advance. 
            Civilians were often caught in the crossfire, and entire neighborhoods were obliterated as the U.S. forces fought to clear the city. The fall of Manila marked the end of Japanese control in the Philippines, paving the way for the final stages of the Pacific War. However, the city itself was left in ruins, with much of its infrastructure and historical landmarks destroyed. 
            The battle also symbolized the immense sacrifice and suffering of the Filipino people during the war, highlighting both the horrors of warfare and the resilience of the population. The devastation of Manila in 1945 left deep scars on the city, its residents, and the broader history of the Philippines, with the battle serving as a stark reminder of the cost of war.
